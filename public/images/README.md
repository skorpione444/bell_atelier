# Hero Image Setup

## Instructions

1. Place your hero image in this folder (`public/images/`)
2. Name it `hero.jpg` (or update the path in `components/Hero.tsx`)
3. Recommended image specs:
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Resolution: 1920px width or larger (for high-quality display)
   - Aspect ratio: 16:9 or wider (will be cropped to fit viewport)
   - File size: Optimized for web (under 500KB recommended)

## Supported Formats
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

The image will automatically:
- Cover the entire hero section
- Apply parallax scroll effects
- Respond to mouse movement
- Maintain aspect ratio with `background-size: cover`
